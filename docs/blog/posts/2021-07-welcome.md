# Hello, docs!

Introductory blog post. I guess I'll write a few words.

<!-- more -->

`goose` was originally open sourced in late 2012 by Liam Staskawicz on [bitbucket.org/liamstask/goose](https://bitbucket.org/liamstask/goose) with an MIT license.

Great project at the time. Remember, Go itself reached [version 1.0](https://blog.golang.org/go1) in the same year (March, 2012).

However, there were a few items left to be desired, and so the Pressly team forked the project in 2016 and has maintained it since. You can read the [Goals of this fork](/goose/#goals-of-this-fork) section for more info. But that's enough looking back. Let's look into the **future**.

We aim to continue maintaining `goose`; adding new features, fixing bugs and providing developer resources to improve the experience. There are also newer features of the standard library and community packages we may consider adopting.

There are lots of issues to triage, and a few burning features we need to implement.

After thousands of migrations in production we've learned a thing or two, and have ideas on how to improve `goose` even more. Stay tuned!
