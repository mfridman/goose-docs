# Experimental commands

!!! warning ""
    Use with caution.

Commands that are prefixed with beta, e.g.,

    goose beta <subcommand> 

Are experimental commands that may have **breaking changes** and do not have the same backward-compatible 
gaurantee as [stable commands](../commands/supported.md). 

Although we try our best to avoid breaking changes, sometimes it is unavoidable for `beta` commands.

At the moment there are **0** beta commands.
